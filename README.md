# 🎌 Anime Tracker (Desktop Edition)

### Built for: _One weeb's sanity._

## 📦 What is this?

This is **Anime Tracker**, a lightweight, no-fuss app I threw together to scratch a very specific itch:  
👉 I needed a quick and easy way to know **when anime episodes were releasing**, without having to dive through streaming platforms, Reddit threads, or questionable wiki pages.

So instead of waiting for someone else to build it...  
I built it myself. For me. And now, for you (if you want it).

## 💻 What does it do?

- 🔍 **Search** for anime titles using the AniList database.
- 🗓️ **Track** release schedules and episode countdowns.
- 📊 Filter by status: _Airing_, _Aired_, _Upcoming_, and _All_.
- 🧠 Local storage-based tracking, no login, no cloud, just your browser remembering stuff.
- 🧽 Drag, drop, delete. Organize your anime list like a digital Marie Kondo.
- 📦 Packaged into an `.exe` so it runs like a desktop app, because this ain’t a website. It's personal.

## 🧠 Why did I make this?

I just wanted something that:

- **Looks clean**
- **Loads fast**
- **Tells me exactly what I need** (When’s the next episode? Has it aired yet?)
- And most importantly: **doesn’t ask me to create an account** or bombard me with a billion other shows I don’t care about.

## 🚀 How to use it

1. Run the `.exe` file (it’s a desktop version of a web app, wrapped up nicely).
2. Search for your favorite anime.
3. Click to add them to your personal tracking list.
4. Enjoy the countdowns, filters, and simplicity.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AniList GraphQL API
- LocalStorage for persistence
- Electron (if you're curious how it's a `.exe`)

> 🧃 This app is for personal use. If it breaks, glitches, or starts speaking in Japanese... well, that’s part of the charm.
